Git is a version control system for tracking code and collab

Git allows version rollback

Git basic terms:
- SSH protocol: method to secure remote login
- Repository: contains project folders
- Fork: copy a repository (put into your own repo)
- Pull request: request review and approval
- Working Directory: contains files and directories
- Commit: snapshot of project's current state
- Branch: separate line of dev
- Merge: combines changes from one branch to another
- Clone: local copy of a Git repo


Github vs Gitlab: Github is only for repository, while Gitlab mostly used for devops and CI/CD

Commit best practices:
- Dont end with period
- Keep it less than 50 characters
- Use active voice (update, fix, init, etc)

In branching, the best practice is to only keep deployable code on the main branch. All features must be coded and tested on other branches.
