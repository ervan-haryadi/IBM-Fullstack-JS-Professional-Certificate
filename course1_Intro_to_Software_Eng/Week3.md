# Programming Languages and Organization
## Type of Programming Language
- Interpreted Languages or scripted language: uses interpreter on computer or browser to translate human-readable code into machine code. Examples are Python, Javascript, Lua, HTML
- Compiled Languages: programs that runs on computer, usually larger size, which are packaged or compiled into one file. Examples are C, C++, C# and Java

Interpreted languages are more versatile and used to run codes that needs to be run often, while compiled languages are used on more complex programs that complete larger tasks. Compiled languages also used to create executable files.

## Programming Language Levels
- High level: used human-readable language (usually English). Example: python, html, SQL
- Low level: used simple symbols to represent machine code. Example: ARM, MIPS, X86
- Query language: used to request data from database or manipulate data in database

## Code Organization
Code organization helps developer in making a good and high-quality code.
Organized codes are easier to read, maintain, and configure
Two methods for code organizations are pseudocode and flowcharts.
Flowcharts display process, while pseudocode explain what each line (of requirement) does

# Programming Logic and Concepts
Programming Logic can be divided into two types:
- Branching: decide which action to take
- Looping: decide how many (or until when) to do actions

Several programming concepts:
- identifier: constant (value can not change) and variables (value can change)
- container: a place to keep hold several values. Examples are array and vector
- Function: a modular programming software to do a single specific action
- Object: a programming concept where data is contained as properties and codes as procedure/method. It is the base for understanding programming methodology Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
