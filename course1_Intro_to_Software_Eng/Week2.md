# Introduction to Development
## Front End Development
Developer uses:
- HTML for physical structures (text, links, images, page dividers, buttons)
- CSS to style websites and give compatibility across multiple browser (PC, tablet, smartphone)
- Javascript for interactive actions

New development in front-end:
- Syntatically Awesome Style Sheet (SASS): extension of CSS that allows usage of variables, nested rules, inline imports to keep things organized
- Learer Style Sheet (LESS): enhances CSS by adding more styles and is backward compatible with CSS. It uses less.js to convert LESS to CSS style
- Website design must be reactive (displays the correct size according to specific screen size) and responsive (will automatically resize to the device)

## Back End Development
While front-end dev creates websites and cloud apps that user interact with, back-end dev creates and manages resources to respond to client's requests by enabling server infrastruture to process requests, supply data and provide other services.

Backend must be able to:
- retrieve, process, and store data
- make API, routing, and endpoints
- Work with databases (SQL and ORM)

## Teamwork
Teamwork in SoftEng:
- Kick-off
- Design and Code Reviews
- Walkthrough
- Retrospectives
- Mentoring

Squads are used in agile development, where a squad usually contains about 10 developers

## Pair Programming
An agile development technique where two developers are writing codes in a single computer
Pair programming styles:
- Driver/Navigator: driver writes, navigator reviews
- Ping Pong: first dev writes tests, second dev writes codes that pass the test. Swapping roles are done regularly
- Strong Style: mentor/junior pair. Junior as driver while mentor as navigator

Benefit:
- Knowledge and skill sharing
- Builds soft skills
- Fewer typo, logic error and bugs
- Code review on the fly
- Identify optimal solution on the spot
- Overall efficiency

Drawbacks:
- Exhausting
- Personal commitment (time restriction)
- A person may takes control
- Personality clash
- Noisy environment

# Tools in Software Development
Application Development Tools to help developers:
- Version control
- Libraries
- Frameworks
- CI/CD
- Build Tools
- Packages
- Package Manager

## Software Stacks
A combination of technologies used to create applications and solutions. It is stacked in a heirarchy to support app dev from user to hardware

Example of software stacks:
- LAMP: Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP
- MEAN: MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, Node.js
- MERN: MongoDB, Express, React.js, Node.js
